        <p>
       I am a Full-Stack Front End Web Developer with special experience in JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Node.js. I'm also an experienced teacher, linguist and a real estate business entrepreneur.I am passionate about approaching programming challenges from different angles, and great at collaborating with others to create meaningful web applications. My personal strengths are creativity, patience, willingness to listen and fast learning. I do well in a team as well as independently. I live in Seattle with my dog Cibi (Cumulonimbus). I like to hike and explore adventures worldwide whenever I can make time. I have traveled solo to Asia, Europe and Central America. I have learned five human languages prior to learning computer language <br><br>
        I like doing roadtrip with my dog and have driven across the US multiple times with her. I have also lived in five States and moved over ten times in the last seven years. My family scatters on three continents of the world: Asia, Europe and the America. I am the only person in the America. I am the youngest in my family and have six older siblings. I am not yet accient as I like to think but my oldest nephew is turning eighteen this year.
