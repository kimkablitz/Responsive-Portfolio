        <p>
        I live in Seattle with my dog Cibi (Cumulonimbus). I like to hike and explore adventures worldwide whenever I can make time. I have traveled solo to Asia, Europe and Central America. I have learned five human languages but failed to master a single computer language. Although I am allegic to alcohol I am not anti-social.<br><br>
        I like doing roadtrip with my dog and have driven across the US multiple times with her. I have also lived in five States and moved over ten times in the last seven years. My family scatters on three continents of the world: Asia, Europe and the America. I am the only person in the America. I am the youngest in my family and have six older siblings. I am not yet accient as I like to think but my oldest nephew is turning eighteen this year.
        <br><br>
        My dog Cibi is a 12 year old Spaniel and Papillon mixed. She won a the American Top dog Model in 2013 and was put on their Calendar prints for the month of May.She was adopted from a shelter in Illinois when she was four and a half. She does not eat corn now but she is a huge help in mowing the lawn. She is not usually playful unfortunately and has always been a quiet dog.
